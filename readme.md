## Weather application

The application allows you to find the coordinates of a specific place and then, based on this data, displays the current and forecast weather. The following information are displayed:

- Current temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind speed
- Weather forecast 5 days ahead


### Entering the site
After entering the site, an `IPLocating` request is sent to download the current location due to our IP address. If successful, another request is sent, but this time to `DarkSky` to download the current weather and display it to the user.


### Adding new city
The site has a "Dodaj miasto" button. After clicking it a hidden section with the form is displayed. After the user has written the city or the entire address, a request is made to the `GeoLocating` API to retrieve latitude and longitude. If it succeeds, another request is sent, but this time to `DarkSky` to download the current weather and display it to the user.
